Deep Learning Image Classification: Dogs vs. Cats

Overview:

This project focuses on implementing a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images of dogs and cats. The model is trained on the Dogs vs. Cats dataset, sourced from Kaggle, to distinguish between images of dogs and cats.

Project Structure:

Data Preparation: The code downloads and preprocesses the Dogs vs. Cats dataset using the ImageDataGenerator class, applying various augmentation techniques such as rotation, shifting, shearing, zooming, and flipping.

Model Architecture: The neural network model is constructed as a sequential model comprising convolutional layers, batch normalization, max-pooling layers, dropout layers, and dense layers with ReLU and sigmoid activation functions.

Model Compilation: The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function. Accuracy is chosen as the evaluation metric for monitoring model performance.

Model Training: The model is trained using the fit method with the training data generator. Training occurs over 10 epochs, and validation data are utilized for monitoring performance.

Performance Visualization: Training and validation accuracy and loss curves are plotted to visualize the model's performance over epochs.

Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using the test data, and the test loss and accuracy are printed to assess its performance.

Prediction: Finally, an example test image of a cat is loaded, preprocessed, and passed through the trained model for prediction. The resulting probability score indicates the likelihood of the image belonging to the cat class.


Results:
After training the model, it achieves a satisfactory accuracy on the test data, demonstrating its ability to effectively classify images of dogs and cats. Additionally, the prediction on a sample test image of a cat yields a probability score, providing insight into the model's confidence in its classification.
